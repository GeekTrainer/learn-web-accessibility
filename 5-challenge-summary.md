In this module we explored the concepts of web accessibility, the tools available, and how to make pages accessible. You learned:

- tools users use to navigate web pages
- tools developers use to ensure accessibility
- skills for ensuring your pages are accessible

## Challenge

The best way to understand how to make pages accessible, and the impact of the decisions you make when creating HTML, is to use some of the tools users use to navigate the web. Navigate a couple of pages with a screen reader. Open a website with a form and use only your keyboard to navigate and complete it. This will give you a sense for what some users experience on a daily basis when using the web, and the importance of ensuring your pages are accessible.
